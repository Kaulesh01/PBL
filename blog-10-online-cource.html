              <p><strong><em>Learn more about inequality and discrimination as they relate to economics, gender, technology, and much more from leading educational institutions </em></strong></p>
          <p>Inequality and discrimination have been a subject of study for fields like history, economics, politics, public policy, gender studies, and much more for decades. How do we achieve a more equal world free from discrimination? In this article, we’ll list 10 courses that seek to answer that question. The courses cover topics like poverty and inequality, gender inequality, anti-discrimination law, inequality in global pandemics, and more. Most of the courses are free to audit with an option to pay for a verified certificate.</p>

          <p>Technology and public policy are closely linked these days. Things like AI and algorithms affect government and industry decisions and reinforce social biases, especially against marginalized communities. There are also concerns about unfair allocations of government funding and emerging technologies to combat global climate change. In this course, you’ll explore the connections between technology, policy, and equality and how inequalities can be addressed. By the course’s end, you’ll be ready to rethink expertise, design, and policy and governance as it relates to technology.</p>
          <p>Shobita Parthasarathy (Professor of Public Policy; Director, Science, Technology and Public Policy program) teaches the course. The course is broken into six weeks, but it can take up to 10 hours to complete a week’s worth of study. Luckily, the course is self-paced, so you can take longer if necessary. The course’s difficulty is not listed, but there don’t appear to be prerequisites.</p>
